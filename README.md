#FAQ (this is a great project)

Add a dedicated FAQ section to your website.

A dedicated FAQ section helps address the basic needs of your users and creates an overall better user experience. If a user wants more information each item can be expanded or stretched to reveal more content by clicking on the plus (+) sign.  If theyâ€™d like to hide the expanded section they can click the minus (-) sign. 

The app comes with several customizable design features that will allow the FAQs section to blend in seamlessly with your website.  Make sure your FAQs are easily accessible and neatly displayed by installing our FAQ app.
